**---Disputed cannabinoids---**

There are some companies marketing products with claimed cannabinoids with the intent of being misleading and hoping the buyer will buy it because it has a bunch of things on the label or something seemingly unique and different and new to try, there aren't any labs to back the claims they are in there and typically labs would suggest the opposite such as accounting for 87% of other cannabinoids or sometimes seemingly not even sure of what they are marketing among other weirdness. Here is a list with a description on each of why they are on this section of the list.

**Delta-11-THC / Exo-THC** is structurally related to THC except if we took the double bond out of the ring and placed it outside next to the 9-methyl group. Its in my opinion that marketers opted for the name of Delta-11-THC instead of Exo-THC so that it may be mistaken with 11-Hydroxy-THC which is a different compound. You can [view an image of its structure here](https://www.mdpi.com/antibiotics/antibiotics-09-00297/article_deploy/html/images/antibiotics-09-00297-i020.png) and other information on its [pubchem page linked here.](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/exo-Tetrahydrocannabinol) While studies on Exo-THC itself is limited studies on analogs suggest that Exo-THC and similar analogs are much weaker than their counterparts. **However one study suggests Exo-THC is an antagonist of CB1 and reduces the effect of THC** ([https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00115a023](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00115a023)) At this point in time (January 2023) I'm not aware of anyone claiming to have high Exo-THC product despite it being claimed on labels but its known that it can be created as a byproduct of synthesis such as Delta-8-THC but does not mean each batch will have it but typically does not have it in seemingly relevant amounts (such as under 1%). Exo-THCP - While no marketer has claimed to have this, Exo-THCP has also been found in some batches of THCP as a byproduct of synthesis but in a small amount similar to Exo-THC in Delta-8-THC. While it might be ""real"" or in ""some batches"" it's unusual to advertise this on a box or as a main feature and is typically seen as scammy marketing to do so.

**CB9 and CBG9** is claimed to be a psychoactive CBD analog, it is claimed to be developed by 2 manufacturers. However, they are refusing to say what CB9 actually is, and are refusing to show what the structure of CB9 may look like because they ""*don't want it to get banned""* (doesn't make sense) and they *""don't want competitors to copy them""* (doesn't make sense). They are claiming they're *""only distributing it in Europe""* (very abnormal for US based). It's been suspected by some that CB9 is a stand in for a synthetic noid structurally unrelated to cannabinoids like THC/CBD, which are sadly semi-common in Europe even rarely being marked as analogs of natural noids. It's possible CB9 is a cover so some other drug can be sold in it's place temporarily and then switch to another cannabinoid at a later date similar to how DiamondCBD sold synthetic indazole noids mismarketed as CBD blends in the past. Manufactures have released a claimed lab test from *""Food &amp; environment safety analytical lab""* which is a lab that appears to have been made out of the blue a year ago for the specific purpose of playing ball with vendors. The lab does not list what drug it's claimed to be but strangely notes *""A semi-qualitative analysis of a novel compound synthesized from 97% precursor (hemp-derived). Result of CB9 is an assumption of 100% consumption and conversion of precursor. Precursor was found to be completely consumed. Range is based off of qualitative analysis using molar absorptivity of precursor molecules.""* The situation surrounding claimed CB9 is extremely sketchy and abnormal. It may be some random drug or nothing unique. Please do not buy from people trying to take advantage of your passion, unwilling to tell you what drug they're selling for you to consume and put in your body, their response is ""don't buy it then"".

**H3CBN** is another made up name for marketing purposes and doesn't refer to any real compound. 

**TRC-5 (Tresconol)** is another made up name for marketing purposes or to hide an illegal or dangerous compound actually used, it doesn't refer to any real compound.

**PHC** sometimes referred to as ""Pentahydrocannabinol"" or ""Proprietary hydrogenated cannabinoid"" has [been claimed to be several different things based on which vendors marketing you listen to](https://i.imgur.com/ogDhp46.png) one vendor claims it's 4'-Hydroxy-CBD (hydroxyl on the 4 position of tailchain) but also uses the tag ""prop hydrogenated"" but 4'-OH-CBD would not be derived from hydrogenation and it's likely other reactions would be occurring, in addition there are no labs to confirm the presence of claimed 4'-OH-CBD, and advertising articles claim it's psychoactive but it's unlikely for 4'-OH-CBD to be active, it's been suggested this vendor is somehow confusing it with H4CBD which is hydrogenated and mildly active but continues to claim it's 4'-OH-CBD. Another vendor has put out marketing images (as seen in the link above) that uses the structure for Exo-THC (mentioned above this entry) and a different ad by a social media marketing company on the behalf of a vendor claims it is similar to THC-O-Acetate but refers to it as ""Hydroxy4PHC"" and claims it acts as a prodrug to THC, at this point in time there is no evidence any of these products contain something unique and the fact several vendors claim it's something different is very suspicious. Typically Pentahydro would refer to extra hydrogen molecules added to the structure but none of the claimed ones seem to fit that description of Penta as we call THC Tetrahydro because it has 4 more hydrogens than Cannabinol.

**THC-X** is claimed to be a proprietary blend of 3 Delta-8-THC esters, specifically claimed to be Acetoacetic, Butyric, and Isovaleric derivatives, some marketing includes the mention of a patent pending but does not specifically mention a patent number. If real they would likely function similar as other THC esters (like THC-O-Acetate) and would likely be prodrugs. However, there are no labs associated with confirmation of these esters in bulk or final product formulations and marketers of THC-X do not indicate how much of each claimed ester makes up the claimed blend. Generally if someone has enough money to synthesize new things others are not or file for a patent they will also have enough money for proper lab testing. Products claiming to contain THC-X show labs claiming up to a combined 87% known noids (D8-THC, D8-THC-O-Acetate, among others) leaving little room for such a blend which has not been noted by the labs used. It should be noted that in the past different vendors have used the term THC-X for different things including claimed Delta-10-THC.

**THC-JD** is a nickname made up by a single manufacture based in New York that they use for marketing what they claim to be is THC-Octyl. The same manufacture claimed to be making THCP awhile back but sent product that was so unusual several vendors (whom did not communicate with eachother prior to this) wanted to return the product and [also called them out on the forum Future4200](https://future4200.com/t/thcp-pricing-turned-broker-whining-doxxing-and-libel/100955) (might have to scroll quite a bit) when they noticed them bagging on another vendor when they themselves are also deceiving people with fake or improperly synthesized THCP. In other emails to vendors this manufacture claimed to only be able to produce ""crude THCP"" with a purity of around 48% similar to the main study which found THCP in Cannabis and they synthesized it to confirm and got a similar yield almost like they were copying the claim. They claimed they would be moving on to other cannabinoids and claimed THC-JD to be THC-Octyl. Labs in regard have either found none or a very small amount such as when bulk material (to put into products) [was tested found to contain only 17% THC-Octyl](https://imgur.com/a/fqJU8Wd) so if a product contains 5% THC-JD that would be 5% of a 17% bulk product which with the past events of either fake/cut or improperly synthesized product does not look very good.

**FX-D8 (FX-Delta-8)** is claimed to be an analog of D8-THC that is claimed to be faster acting, however, no testing or structure has been claimed for FX-D8 and appears to be another made up thing to slap on a box to convince a store to buy and a custy to buy

**THC-Octyl (THC-C8)** If an unrelated manufacture truly decides to synthesize THC-Octyl they will likely just call it THC-Octyl and have proper labs done to show for it. THC-Octyl is similar to THC itself but with the Pentyl tailchain extended to Octyl.

**THC-Methoxy** **(THC-M** / THC methyl ester and THC-O-Methyl) has been claimed by some vendors but there are no to very limited labs in regard to support it at this point in time. Similar to other esters of THC it is believed to function as a prodrug, however **studies suggest D9-THC-O-Methyl is 25x less active than D9-THC itself in dogs** ([https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00115a023](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00115a023)) while THC-O-Acetate was 2.5x more active . It should be noted that there can be other ""THC Methoxy"" analogs created at different positions such as 9-Methoxy-THC and 10-Methoxy-THC for example which is different from THC-O-Methyl, [here is an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalCannabinoids/comments/r6sxri/cbd_conversion_derivatives_poster_not_a_full_list/) and it should be noted that sometimes ""THC-M"" has been used to refer to it but if so it's important not to confuse it with other methoxy analogs or THC-Morpholinylbutyrate which has sometimes been called THC-M as well.

**THC-MEO** / MEO-THC and **MEO-HHC** / HHC-MEO - Refers to Methoxy, see the above entry

**11-Hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC)** is better known as one of the major metabolites of THC after consumption. Both inhalation and edibles produce the 11-OH-THC metabolite but studies show that people produce significantly more per milligram at a time when used as an edible. As of August 2023 several products sold claiming to have 11-OH-THC have been found to contain none and appear to be using the claim for marketing. Typically these products forget there is 11-OH-D8-THC and 11-OH-D9-THC and fail to specify which one they're claiming. **However** on October 19th, 2023 an entity teased a lab test that may be a legitimate 11-OH-Delta-8-THC. While no products currently contain any 11-OH-THC (beyond ones lying for marketing) as of Oct 19th, 2023, it's possible future ones might. However because of the amount of fakes claiming to have it before it may be hard to identify what is legitimate and what is not.

**Delta-10-THC (D10-THC)** is an isomer of THC similar to THC in that the double bond is shifted but over to the 10 position inside the delta ring, despite many brands claiming high purity Delta-10-THC a majority of these products report containing Delta-6a10a-THC on their labs which is a separate substance. It's possible that Delta-10-THC as well as Delta-6a10a-THC may be in some batches of Delta-8-THC as a byproduct of synthesis, [more information on that can be viewed with detail here](https://www.caymanchem.com/news/degradants-formed-during-phytocannabinoid-processing), note that it can create a split 9R vs 9S epimers which likely have different potency. Studies in regards appears to suggest that Delta-10-THC is less potent than Delta-9-THC and Delta-8-THC.

**Delta-6a10a-THC** (ParaPentyl / EA-1477 (Used to be called Delta-3-THC under the old monoterpenoid numbering, however as a closed ring dibenzopyran it should use dibenzopyran numbering) it is an isomer of THC with the double bond shifted to the 6a10a position (instead of delta 8 or delta 9) meaning it also has a cyclohexyl C ring. It's possible that Delta-6a10a-THC may be in some batches of Delta-8-THC as well as Delta-10-THC as a byproduct of synthesis, [more information can be viewed here](https://www.caymanchem.com/news/degradants-formed-during-phytocannabinoid-processing), note that it can also create a split 9R vs 9S epimers which have different potency with the 9S epimer reportedly being more potent than the 9R epimer. It's less potent than Delta-9-THC and Delta-8-THC in effect. It was studied by Harold F. Hardman in 1955 (before the cannabinoid receptors was discovered) on behalf of the U.S government and noted that it induced sedation and had antiepileptic effects when injected into dogs and monkeys with reportedly no major effect on blood pressure despite varying dosages. It was described in the study as ""one of the greatest margins of safety of any drug known when administered intravenously to dogs."".

**Delta-6 (D6)** Most vendors are using this name as another name for Delta-6a10a-THC (scroll down below to commonly known cannabinoids) However, Delta-6 may also refer to an isomer of CBD but with the double bond shifted over to the 6 position (monoterpenoid numbering for CBD if we were to be using benzopyran like THC this would be the 8 position), it has been hypothesized to be mildly psychoactive, only a very slim few marketers have tried to claim this in the past but none had labs (as of January 2023) but could exist at some point in the future. It's appears some brands are mismarketing Delta-6a10a-THC as Delta-6 (separately, Delta-6a-THC (and Delta-6-THC as well) are not known to be available at this time.

**11-Hydroxy-HHC (11-OH-HHC)** \- Is a known metabolite of HHC akin to what 11-OH-THC is to THC, there are no claims of it being sold by anyone as of February 2023.

**THCA** (Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) is one of the main naturally occurring cannabinoids that the cannabis plant produces, it can be found naturally within flower and extracts, **but** being sold in vape carts or edible products is typically a sign of scammy marketing. Because THCA recrystallizes it's near impossible to get a relevant amount of it to blend into a cart without recrystallizing. Using heat would decarb THCA into D9-THC and it wouldn't be THCA anymore. Additionally THCA as an edible would be inactive for psych activity but may have non-psychoactive anti-inflammatory benefit. Some places appear to be slapping THCA on the box for marketing purposes selling the same old D8, HHC and other stuff as a unique blend while others seem to be using it as a cover for D9 but it seems more scammy marketing than anything else at this point in time.

**---Commonly known cannabinoids---**

A list of some commonly talked about cannabinoids here with a short description of each.

**Delta-8-THC** is an isomer of THC that can be derived from CBD from an acid based cyclization to close CBDs open southern ring and processes selective to make Delta-8-THC. D8-THC Structurally D8-THC is very similar to D9-THC except with the double bond that makes up that delta position shifted over. D-8-THC has similar binding affinity at the CB1 receptor, about 44nM (D8-THC) vs 40.1nM (D9-THC) with relatively similar CB2 binding depending on the reference used with other suggesting more evenly balanced binding with D8-THC. D8-THC is described as being less potent than D9-THC in effect supported by several studies done in people dating back to the 1973s as well as more recent studies in 2022.

**HHC (Hexahydrocannabinol)** is structurally very similar to THC except that the double carbon bond that would typically make up the delta 8 or delta 9 position has been removed from its structure and replaced with 2 hydrogen groups. HHC can be derived from Delta-8-THC from an hydrogenation processes to ""degrade"" or ""break"" the double bond in its structure. This results in 2 epimers commonly referred to as 9R-HHC and 9S-HHC with 9R-HHC showing higher potency. HHC is typically described by most as being more potent than Delta-8-THC but less potent than Delta-9-THC although it's important to note not everyone agrees with that and feel it can vary.

**10-Hydroxy-HHC (10-OH-HHC)** \- Is a known minor metabolite of HHC but recently there are reports of it being sold with a internal analysis for labs. Similar to HHC itself stereochemistry at the 9-Methyl group (9S vs 9R) can vary as well as well as the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group (10beta vs 10alpha). It's reportedly crystalline in appearance and reforms back hard easily. While no hemp labs are testing for it as of yet, the internal analysis and paperwork put together by a manufacturer appears to suggests it's more legitimate than not.

**8-Hydroxy-HHC (8-OH-HHC)** \- Is a known minor metabolite of HHC but recently there are reports of it being sold with an internal analysis for labs. Similar to HHC itself stereochemistry at the 9-Methyl group (9S vs 9R) can vary as well as well as the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group (8beta vs 8alpha). The 8alpha (Alpha-8-OH-HHC (8S,9S) isomer is more potent) It's reportedly very physically stable and can be broken like chunks and can be touched without sticky residue like other distillates. It reportedly also reforms back hard easily. While no hemp labs are testing for it as of yet, the internal analysis and paperwork put together by a manufacturer appears to suggests it's more legitimate than not.

**HHCA** (Hexahydrocannabinolic acid) is the carboxy acid analog of HHC. It is akin to what THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) is to THC. HHCA has been patented for partial synthesis process and potential medical use. When heat is applied to HHCA it will decarb into HHC, but HHCA is much more stable crystalline ""hard rock like"" making it easier to handle without stickiness of distillate.

**H4CBD** (TetrahydroCBD and CyclohexylCBD) is structurally very similar to CBD except that the double carbon bond that would typically make up the delta-1 position and the 8 position (It's important to note ""open ringed idiols"" related to CBD use monoterpenoid numbering instead of the closed ring benzopyran numbering like THC) resulting in the addition of 4 hydrogens to it's structure. Unlike CBD and most CBD derivatives studies have shown H4CBD to bind to the CB1 receptor about 145nM, the cyclohexyl ring has been implicated in it's ability to bind to the CB1 receptor with relevant activity despite the open southern ring. It's potency relative to other mild CB1 agonists such as CBN has been disputed. H4CBD has been mentioned as having a short duration of action by some users but this has been disputed by others.

**CBN (Cannabinol)** was the first cannabinoid discovered in Cannabis and is structurally similar to THC (Tetrahydro-cannabinol) except it has and additional 2 double carbon bonds added to its C ring. It can be derived through the oxidative degration of THC, while this process can occur naturally in small amounts it is often made through lab oxidation processes. CBN has a binding affinity of about 211nM at CB1 and 126nM at CB2. CBN is mildly psychoactive in effect and has been described by most as being sleepy and sedating compared to other cannabinoids although this has been disputed by others.

**CBD (Cannabidiol)** is a well known open ringed derivative of THC that primarily acts as a CB1 NAM (negative allosteric modulator) and an GPR55 antagonist and an 5HT1A inverse agonist with actions at other sites. CBD can be derived from the Cannabis plant via various extraction methods.

**THCV (Tetrahydrocannabivarin)** is structurally related to THC except with THCs Pentyl tailchain shortened to Propyl. THCV is a CB1 antagonist and CB2 agonist, studies suggest in high doses it may behave as a CB1 agonist. It's important to note there is both Delta-8-THCV and Delta-9-THCV although both seem to function similarly as CB1 antagonists with different binding affinity.

**THCP (Tetrahydrocannabiphorol)** (THC-Heptyl / THC-C7) is structurally related to THC except with THCs Pentyl tailchain extended to Heptyl. Delta-8-THCP has a binding affinity of about 22nM at CB1 while Delta-9-THCP has a binding affinity of about 1.2nM at CB1. It has often been marketed as ""33x stronger"" due to this as it has about 33x higher binding affinity when compared to D9-THCs 40nM result, but while it suggests higher potency it does not equate to a 33x higher effect level and while described by most as strong and long lasting, the levels of potency claimed and often marketed have been disputed by some.

**THCB (Tetrahydrocannabutol)** (THC-Butyl / THC-C4) is structurally related to THC except with THCs Pentyl tailchain shortened to Butyl. Delta-9-THCB has a binding affinity of about 15nM at CB1 and 51nM at CB2. It's noted for having high COVID-19 3C-like protease inhibitor activity in studies evaluated on a select group of cannabinoids. Delta-8-THCB has a binding affinity of 65nM at CB1.

**THCH (Tetrahydrocannabihexol)** (THC-Hexyl / THC-C6) is structurally related to THC except with THCs Pentyl tailchain extended to Hexyl.

**THCA (Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid)** (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THC-O-ACETATE) is the primary naturally occurring cannabinoid in psychoactive Cannabis. When Cannabis flower is smoked or vaped the heat converts THCA into D9-THC to provide the effects. THCA itself does not bind to the cannabinoid receptors without first being converted into D9-THC but is a COX 1 and 2 inhibitor and FAAH enzyme inhibitor and Anandamide transporter and a TRPV1 and TRPV2 agonist suggesting anti-inflammatory activity.

**Delta-10-THC** and Delta-6a10a-THC (see the above list)

**THC-O-Acetate** is structurally related to THC except with an acetyl group attached to THCs hydroxy group, like other THC esters it's believed to function as a prodrug to THC. It's important to note that there is both Delta-8-THC-O-Acetate as well as Delta-9-THC-O-Acetate. There is typically a delay in effect before full effects are felt, possibly due to the deacetylation process in the body to remove the acetyl group so the free THC can produce an effect. Unlike some other drugs such as Salicylic acid or Morphine, THC only seems a limited boost in bioavailability because it is already very lipophilic but it's been hypothesized to have higher oral (by mouth/edible) bioavailability but this has not been proven as of January 2023. THC-O-Acetate has sometimes been marketed as 3x stronger than THC but this is seemingly based off a single study in dogs where it produced 2.5x sedation that have not been followed up on. In 1974 it was described in the popular book Cannabis Alchemy as being ""more spiritual and psychedelic"" although this has been disputed by many users. It's been suggested by some that in the 1970s the CB receptors were not discovered yet and THC was promoted as being an ""atypical hallucinogen"" which may of had influence. Most users seem to agree that THC-O-Acetate feels like it overall lasts longer than THC. Most other acetylated cannabinoids seem to follow this trend. A more definitive user-survey based study has been conducted and is currently being compiled and will be linked here when published that hopes to show more into user reported experiences with (D8 and D9) THC-O-Acetate and it's comparison to (D8 and D9) THC itself.

**CBG (Cannabigerol)** is sometimes called ""the mother cannabinoid"" since a majority of phytocannabinoids are biosynthesized from CBGA in the plant. There are various high (10%+) CBGA hemp strains and can be derived from the Cannabis plant via various extraction methods. CBG is a strong alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and moderate 5HT1A antagonist. Studies have suggested it to be a weak agonist and antagonist with a binding affinity of 896nM at CB1 and 153nM at CB2. Studies suggest CBG may quickly metabolize into Cyclo-CBG (cyclo not to be confused with cyclohexyl).

**Cannabichromene (CBC)** (cannanbichromene /  cannabinochromene) is a benzopyran based cannabinoid. CBC is typically considered non-psychoactive by most studies and user reports although some disagree. At least one in vitro study puts CBCs binding affinity of 713nM at CB1 and 256nM at CB2 and reports it's unknown what type of activity it has on the receptor, past studies have put the binding at under 1,000nM. CBC is a TRPV1 and TRPV1A agonist. Its antinociception activity has been suggested to be unrelated to its CB1/CB2 action as demonstrated by a study with an antagonist. It may enhance the antinociception and antiinflammatory effects of THC in vitro. CBC lowers glutathione levels in vitro.

**Cannabicitran (CBT)** not to be confused with Cannabitriol which is also sometimes called CBT. As of January 2023 it seems only Cannabicitran is marketed as CBT at this point in time. Cannabicitran is a benzopyran based cannabinoid structurally similar to THC. It's believed to be non-psychoactive and a NAGly (GPR18) agonist known to reduce intraocular pressure although does not bind to it as high as THC.

**Beta-Caryophyllene (BCP)** is a terpene structurally unrelated to THC, CBD and other classical cannabinoids that acts as a full agonist of the CB2 receptor with an affinity of about 126nM and no activity at CB1. It can be found naturally within Cannabis among several other plants and foods. It should be noted that Caryophyllene oxide is not known to act on the cannabinoid receptors.

**---""Spice""/""K2"" noids vs these cannabinoids--**

The cannabinoids that went into synthetic blends like ""Spice"" and ""K2"" are structurally unrelated to the cannabinoids in cannabis, there is newer research linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalCannabinoids/comments/rz2h8f/study_aminoalkylindoles_bind_to_a_second_site/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalCannabinoids/comments/rz2d1f/study_there_is_some_evidence_that_the_indoles/) that suggests because those cannabinoids are so structurally different that they can interact with different subtypes inside of the CB1 (and CB2) receptor that ""classical cannabinoids"" (analogs of THC and CBD) may not be able to interact with among other hypothesis to contribution such as aromatic stacking.

Structurally this difference is clear, [here is an example](https://imgur.com/a/hvM1Ndg) of ""classical cannabinoids"" (analogs of THC and CBD), and [here is an example](https://imgur.com/a/kGvMM6h) of some indole and indazole core noids that went into some ""spice/k2"" blends. Here is another visual example of this difference [https://imgur.com/6d21TpF](https://imgur.com/6d21TpF)  The noids that went into spice/k2 are so different that we do not allow their open discussion on this subreddit.

**---What defines an altnoid---**

Despite what Urban Dictionary claims there is none, this subreddit is for discussion of cannabinoids and and are alt to the cannabinoid subreddit as in the name was already taken as opposed to something else but the term ""altnoids"" has been used to describe Delta-8-THC, HHC, CBN and basically every other cannabinoid besides THC online but this is doesn't make much sense, they are just cannabinoids. This subreddit is dedicated to discussion of cannabinoids that have been found within or derived from compounds found within Cannabis, we allow discussion of all classical cannabinoids (analogs of THC and CBD) as well as discussion of cannabinoids found in other plants and fungi.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---Disputed cannabinoids---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some companies marketing products with claimed cannabinoids with the intent of being misleading and hoping the buyer will buy it because it has a bunch of things on the label or something seemingly unique and different and new to try, there aren&amp;#39;t any labs to back the claims they are in there and typically labs would suggest the opposite such as accounting for 87% of other cannabinoids or sometimes seemingly not even sure of what they are marketing among other weirdness. Here is a list with a description on each of why they are on this section of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta-11-THC / Exo-THC&lt;/strong&gt; is structurally related to THC except if we took the double bond out of the ring and placed it outside next to the 9-methyl group. Its in my opinion that marketers opted for the name of Delta-11-THC instead of Exo-THC so that it may be mistaken with 11-Hydroxy-THC which is a different compound. You can &lt;a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/antibiotics/antibiotics-09-00297/article_deploy/html/images/antibiotics-09-00297-i020.png""&gt;view an image of its structure here&lt;/a&gt; and other information on its &lt;a href=""https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/exo-Tetrahydrocannabinol""&gt;pubchem page linked here.&lt;/a&gt; While studies on Exo-THC itself is limited studies on analogs suggest that Exo-THC and similar analogs are much weaker than their counterparts. &lt;strong&gt;However one study suggests Exo-THC is an antagonist of CB1 and reduces the effect of THC&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00115a023""&gt;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00115a023&lt;/a&gt;) At this point in time (January 2023) I&amp;#39;m not aware of anyone claiming to have high Exo-THC product despite it being claimed on labels but its known that it can be created as a byproduct of synthesis such as Delta-8-THC but does not mean each batch will have it but typically does not have it in seemingly relevant amounts (such as under 1%). Exo-THCP - While no marketer has claimed to have this, Exo-THCP has also been found in some batches of THCP as a byproduct of synthesis but in a small amount similar to Exo-THC in Delta-8-THC. While it might be &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; or in &amp;quot;some batches&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s unusual to advertise this on a box or as a main feature and is typically seen as scammy marketing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CB9 and CBG9&lt;/strong&gt; is claimed to be a psychoactive CBD analog, it is claimed to be developed by 2 manufacturers. However, they are refusing to say what CB9 actually is, and are refusing to show what the structure of CB9 may look like because they &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t want it to get banned&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; (doesn&amp;#39;t make sense) and they &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t want competitors to copy them&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; (doesn&amp;#39;t make sense). They are claiming they&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;only distributing it in Europe&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; (very abnormal for US based). It&amp;#39;s been suspected by some that CB9 is a stand in for a synthetic noid structurally unrelated to cannabinoids like THC/CBD, which are sadly semi-common in Europe even rarely being marked as analogs of natural noids. It&amp;#39;s possible CB9 is a cover so some other drug can be sold in it&amp;#39;s place temporarily and then switch to another cannabinoid at a later date similar to how DiamondCBD sold synthetic indazole noids mismarketed as CBD blends in the past. Manufactures have released a claimed lab test from &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Food &amp;amp; environment safety analytical lab&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; which is a lab that appears to have been made out of the blue a year ago for the specific purpose of playing ball with vendors. The lab does not list what drug it&amp;#39;s claimed to be but strangely notes &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;A semi-qualitative analysis of a novel compound synthesized from 97% precursor (hemp-derived). Result of CB9 is an assumption of 100% consumption and conversion of precursor. Precursor was found to be completely consumed. Range is based off of qualitative analysis using molar absorptivity of precursor molecules.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The situation surrounding claimed CB9 is extremely sketchy and abnormal. It may be some random drug or nothing unique. Please do not buy from people trying to take advantage of your passion, unwilling to tell you what drug they&amp;#39;re selling for you to consume and put in your body, their response is &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t buy it then&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H3CBN&lt;/strong&gt; is another made up name for marketing purposes and doesn&amp;#39;t refer to any real compound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRC-5 (Tresconol)&lt;/strong&gt; is another made up name for marketing purposes or to hide an illegal or dangerous compound actually used, it doesn&amp;#39;t refer to any real compound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHC&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;Pentahydrocannabinol&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Proprietary hydrogenated cannabinoid&amp;quot; has &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ogDhp46.png""&gt;been claimed to be several different things based on which vendors marketing you listen to&lt;/a&gt; one vendor claims it&amp;#39;s 4&amp;#39;-Hydroxy-CBD (hydroxyl on the 4 position of tailchain) but also uses the tag &amp;quot;prop hydrogenated&amp;quot; but 4&amp;#39;-OH-CBD would not be derived from hydrogenation and it&amp;#39;s likely other reactions would be occurring, in addition there are no labs to confirm the presence of claimed 4&amp;#39;-OH-CBD, and advertising articles claim it&amp;#39;s psychoactive but it&amp;#39;s unlikely for 4&amp;#39;-OH-CBD to be active, it&amp;#39;s been suggested this vendor is somehow confusing it with H4CBD which is hydrogenated and mildly active but continues to claim it&amp;#39;s 4&amp;#39;-OH-CBD. Another vendor has put out marketing images (as seen in the link above) that uses the structure for Exo-THC (mentioned above this entry) and a different ad by a social media marketing company on the behalf of a vendor claims it is similar to THC-O-Acetate but refers to it as &amp;quot;Hydroxy4PHC&amp;quot; and claims it acts as a prodrug to THC, at this point in time there is no evidence any of these products contain something unique and the fact several vendors claim it&amp;#39;s something different is very suspicious. Typically Pentahydro would refer to extra hydrogen molecules added to the structure but none of the claimed ones seem to fit that description of Penta as we call THC Tetrahydro because it has 4 more hydrogens than Cannabinol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC-X&lt;/strong&gt; is claimed to be a proprietary blend of 3 Delta-8-THC esters, specifically claimed to be Acetoacetic, Butyric, and Isovaleric derivatives, some marketing includes the mention of a patent pending but does not specifically mention a patent number. If real they would likely function similar as other THC esters (like THC-O-Acetate) and would likely be prodrugs. However, there are no labs associated with confirmation of these esters in bulk or final product formulations and marketers of THC-X do not indicate how much of each claimed ester makes up the claimed blend. Generally if someone has enough money to synthesize new things others are not or file for a patent they will also have enough money for proper lab testing. Products claiming to contain THC-X show labs claiming up to a combined 87% known noids (D8-THC, D8-THC-O-Acetate, among others) leaving little room for such a blend which has not been noted by the labs used. It should be noted that in the past different vendors have used the term THC-X for different things including claimed Delta-10-THC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC-JD&lt;/strong&gt; is a nickname made up by a single manufacture based in New York that they use for marketing what they claim to be is THC-Octyl. The same manufacture claimed to be making THCP awhile back but sent product that was so unusual several vendors (whom did not communicate with eachother prior to this) wanted to return the product and &lt;a href=""https://future4200.com/t/thcp-pricing-turned-broker-whining-doxxing-and-libel/100955""&gt;also called them out on the forum Future4200&lt;/a&gt; (might have to scroll quite a bit) when they noticed them bagging on another vendor when they themselves are also deceiving people with fake or improperly synthesized THCP. In other emails to vendors this manufacture claimed to only be able to produce &amp;quot;crude THCP&amp;quot; with a purity of around 48% similar to the main study which found THCP in Cannabis and they synthesized it to confirm and got a similar yield almost like they were copying the claim. They claimed they would be moving on to other cannabinoids and claimed THC-JD to be THC-Octyl. Labs in regard have either found none or a very small amount such as when bulk material (to put into products) &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/fqJU8Wd""&gt;was tested found to contain only 17% THC-Octyl&lt;/a&gt; so if a product contains 5% THC-JD that would be 5% of a 17% bulk product which with the past events of either fake/cut or improperly synthesized product does not look very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FX-D8 (FX-Delta-8)&lt;/strong&gt; is claimed to be an analog of D8-THC that is claimed to be faster acting, however, no testing or structure has been claimed for FX-D8 and appears to be another made up thing to slap on a box to convince a store to buy and a custy to buy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC-Octyl (THC-C8)&lt;/strong&gt; If an unrelated manufacture truly decides to synthesize THC-Octyl they will likely just call it THC-Octyl and have proper labs done to show for it. THC-Octyl is similar to THC itself but with the Pentyl tailchain extended to Octyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC-Methoxy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(THC-M&lt;/strong&gt; / THC methyl ester and THC-O-Methyl) has been claimed by some vendors but there are no to very limited labs in regard to support it at this point in time. Similar to other esters of THC it is believed to function as a prodrug, however &lt;strong&gt;studies suggest D9-THC-O-Methyl is 25x less active than D9-THC itself in dogs&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00115a023""&gt;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00115a023&lt;/a&gt;) while THC-O-Acetate was 2.5x more active . It should be noted that there can be other &amp;quot;THC Methoxy&amp;quot; analogs created at different positions such as 9-Methoxy-THC and 10-Methoxy-THC for example which is different from THC-O-Methyl, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalCannabinoids/comments/r6sxri/cbd_conversion_derivatives_poster_not_a_full_list/""&gt;here is an example&lt;/a&gt; and it should be noted that sometimes &amp;quot;THC-M&amp;quot; has been used to refer to it but if so it&amp;#39;s important not to confuse it with other methoxy analogs or THC-Morpholinylbutyrate which has sometimes been called THC-M as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC-MEO&lt;/strong&gt; / MEO-THC and &lt;strong&gt;MEO-HHC&lt;/strong&gt; / HHC-MEO - Refers to Methoxy, see the above entry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11-Hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC)&lt;/strong&gt; is better known as one of the major metabolites of THC after consumption. Both inhalation and edibles produce the 11-OH-THC metabolite but studies show that people produce significantly more per milligram at a time when used as an edible. As of August 2023 several products sold claiming to have 11-OH-THC have been found to contain none and appear to be using the claim for marketing. Typically these products forget there is 11-OH-D8-THC and 11-OH-D9-THC and fail to specify which one they&amp;#39;re claiming. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt; on October 19th, 2023 an entity teased a lab test that may be a legitimate 11-OH-Delta-8-THC. While no products currently contain any 11-OH-THC (beyond ones lying for marketing) as of Oct 19th, 2023, it&amp;#39;s possible future ones might. However because of the amount of fakes claiming to have it before it may be hard to identify what is legitimate and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta-10-THC (D10-THC)&lt;/strong&gt; is an isomer of THC similar to THC in that the double bond is shifted but over to the 10 position inside the delta ring, despite many brands claiming high purity Delta-10-THC a majority of these products report containing Delta-6a10a-THC on their labs which is a separate substance. It&amp;#39;s possible that Delta-10-THC as well as Delta-6a10a-THC may be in some batches of Delta-8-THC as a byproduct of synthesis, &lt;a href=""https://www.caymanchem.com/news/degradants-formed-during-phytocannabinoid-processing""&gt;more information on that can be viewed with detail here&lt;/a&gt;, note that it can create a split 9R vs 9S epimers which likely have different potency. Studies in regards appears to suggest that Delta-10-THC is less potent than Delta-9-THC and Delta-8-THC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta-6a10a-THC&lt;/strong&gt; (ParaPentyl / EA-1477 (Used to be called Delta-3-THC under the old monoterpenoid numbering, however as a closed ring dibenzopyran it should use dibenzopyran numbering) it is an isomer of THC with the double bond shifted to the 6a10a position (instead of delta 8 or delta 9) meaning it also has a cyclohexyl C ring. It&amp;#39;s possible that Delta-6a10a-THC may be in some batches of Delta-8-THC as well as Delta-10-THC as a byproduct of synthesis, &lt;a href=""https://www.caymanchem.com/news/degradants-formed-during-phytocannabinoid-processing""&gt;more information can be viewed here&lt;/a&gt;, note that it can also create a split 9R vs 9S epimers which have different potency with the 9S epimer reportedly being more potent than the 9R epimer. It&amp;#39;s less potent than Delta-9-THC and Delta-8-THC in effect. It was studied by Harold F. Hardman in 1955 (before the cannabinoid receptors was discovered) on behalf of the U.S government and noted that it induced sedation and had antiepileptic effects when injected into dogs and monkeys with reportedly no major effect on blood pressure despite varying dosages. It was described in the study as &amp;quot;one of the greatest margins of safety of any drug known when administered intravenously to dogs.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta-6 (D6)&lt;/strong&gt; Most vendors are using this name as another name for Delta-6a10a-THC (scroll down below to commonly known cannabinoids) However, Delta-6 may also refer to an isomer of CBD but with the double bond shifted over to the 6 position (monoterpenoid numbering for CBD if we were to be using benzopyran like THC this would be the 8 position), it has been hypothesized to be mildly psychoactive, only a very slim few marketers have tried to claim this in the past but none had labs (as of January 2023) but could exist at some point in the future. It&amp;#39;s appears some brands are mismarketing Delta-6a10a-THC as Delta-6 (separately, Delta-6a-THC (and Delta-6-THC as well) are not known to be available at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11-Hydroxy-HHC (11-OH-HHC)&lt;/strong&gt; - Is a known metabolite of HHC akin to what 11-OH-THC is to THC, there are no claims of it being sold by anyone as of February 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THCA&lt;/strong&gt; (Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) is one of the main naturally occurring cannabinoids that the cannabis plant produces, it can be found naturally within flower and extracts, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; being sold in vape carts or edible products is typically a sign of scammy marketing. Because THCA recrystallizes it&amp;#39;s near impossible to get a relevant amount of it to blend into a cart without recrystallizing. Using heat would decarb THCA into D9-THC and it wouldn&amp;#39;t be THCA anymore. Additionally THCA as an edible would be inactive for psych activity but may have non-psychoactive anti-inflammatory benefit. Some places appear to be slapping THCA on the box for marketing purposes selling the same old D8, HHC and other stuff as a unique blend while others seem to be using it as a cover for D9 but it seems more scammy marketing than anything else at this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---Commonly known cannabinoids---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of some commonly talked about cannabinoids here with a short description of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta-8-THC&lt;/strong&gt; is an isomer of THC that can be derived from CBD from an acid based cyclization to close CBDs open southern ring and processes selective to make Delta-8-THC. D8-THC Structurally D8-THC is very similar to D9-THC except with the double bond that makes up that delta position shifted over. D-8-THC has similar binding affinity at the CB1 receptor, about 44nM (D8-THC) vs 40.1nM (D9-THC) with relatively similar CB2 binding depending on the reference used with other suggesting more evenly balanced binding with D8-THC. D8-THC is described as being less potent than D9-THC in effect supported by several studies done in people dating back to the 1973s as well as more recent studies in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HHC (Hexahydrocannabinol)&lt;/strong&gt; is structurally very similar to THC except that the double carbon bond that would typically make up the delta 8 or delta 9 position has been removed from its structure and replaced with 2 hydrogen groups. HHC can be derived from Delta-8-THC from an hydrogenation processes to &amp;quot;degrade&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; the double bond in its structure. This results in 2 epimers commonly referred to as 9R-HHC and 9S-HHC with 9R-HHC showing higher potency. HHC is typically described by most as being more potent than Delta-8-THC but less potent than Delta-9-THC although it&amp;#39;s important to note not everyone agrees with that and feel it can vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10-Hydroxy-HHC (10-OH-HHC)&lt;/strong&gt; - Is a known minor metabolite of HHC but recently there are reports of it being sold with a internal analysis for labs. Similar to HHC itself stereochemistry at the 9-Methyl group (9S vs 9R) can vary as well as well as the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group (10beta vs 10alpha). It&amp;#39;s reportedly crystalline in appearance and reforms back hard easily. While no hemp labs are testing for it as of yet, the internal analysis and paperwork put together by a manufacturer appears to suggests it&amp;#39;s more legitimate than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8-Hydroxy-HHC (8-OH-HHC)&lt;/strong&gt; - Is a known minor metabolite of HHC but recently there are reports of it being sold with an internal analysis for labs. Similar to HHC itself stereochemistry at the 9-Methyl group (9S vs 9R) can vary as well as well as the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group (8beta vs 8alpha). The 8alpha (Alpha-8-OH-HHC (8S,9S) isomer is more potent) It&amp;#39;s reportedly very physically stable and can be broken like chunks and can be touched without sticky residue like other distillates. It reportedly also reforms back hard easily. While no hemp labs are testing for it as of yet, the internal analysis and paperwork put together by a manufacturer appears to suggests it&amp;#39;s more legitimate than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HHCA&lt;/strong&gt; (Hexahydrocannabinolic acid) is the carboxy acid analog of HHC. It is akin to what THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) is to THC. HHCA has been patented for partial synthesis process and potential medical use. When heat is applied to HHCA it will decarb into HHC, but HHCA is much more stable crystalline &amp;quot;hard rock like&amp;quot; making it easier to handle without stickiness of distillate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H4CBD&lt;/strong&gt; (TetrahydroCBD and CyclohexylCBD) is structurally very similar to CBD except that the double carbon bond that would typically make up the delta-1 position and the 8 position (It&amp;#39;s important to note &amp;quot;open ringed idiols&amp;quot; related to CBD use monoterpenoid numbering instead of the closed ring benzopyran numbering like THC) resulting in the addition of 4 hydrogens to it&amp;#39;s structure. Unlike CBD and most CBD derivatives studies have shown H4CBD to bind to the CB1 receptor about 145nM, the cyclohexyl ring has been implicated in it&amp;#39;s ability to bind to the CB1 receptor with relevant activity despite the open southern ring. It&amp;#39;s potency relative to other mild CB1 agonists such as CBN has been disputed. H4CBD has been mentioned as having a short duration of action by some users but this has been disputed by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBN (Cannabinol)&lt;/strong&gt; was the first cannabinoid discovered in Cannabis and is structurally similar to THC (Tetrahydro-cannabinol) except it has and additional 2 double carbon bonds added to its C ring. It can be derived through the oxidative degration of THC, while this process can occur naturally in small amounts it is often made through lab oxidation processes. CBN has a binding affinity of about 211nM at CB1 and 126nM at CB2. CBN is mildly psychoactive in effect and has been described by most as being sleepy and sedating compared to other cannabinoids although this has been disputed by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBD (Cannabidiol)&lt;/strong&gt; is a well known open ringed derivative of THC that primarily acts as a CB1 NAM (negative allosteric modulator) and an GPR55 antagonist and an 5HT1A inverse agonist with actions at other sites. CBD can be derived from the Cannabis plant via various extraction methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THCV (Tetrahydrocannabivarin)&lt;/strong&gt; is structurally related to THC except with THCs Pentyl tailchain shortened to Propyl. THCV is a CB1 antagonist and CB2 agonist, studies suggest in high doses it may behave as a CB1 agonist. It&amp;#39;s important to note there is both Delta-8-THCV and Delta-9-THCV although both seem to function similarly as CB1 antagonists with different binding affinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THCP (Tetrahydrocannabiphorol)&lt;/strong&gt; (THC-Heptyl / THC-C7) is structurally related to THC except with THCs Pentyl tailchain extended to Heptyl. Delta-8-THCP has a binding affinity of about 22nM at CB1 while Delta-9-THCP has a binding affinity of about 1.2nM at CB1. It has often been marketed as &amp;quot;33x stronger&amp;quot; due to this as it has about 33x higher binding affinity when compared to D9-THCs 40nM result, but while it suggests higher potency it does not equate to a 33x higher effect level and while described by most as strong and long lasting, the levels of potency claimed and often marketed have been disputed by some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THCB (Tetrahydrocannabutol)&lt;/strong&gt; (THC-Butyl / THC-C4) is structurally related to THC except with THCs Pentyl tailchain shortened to Butyl. Delta-9-THCB has a binding affinity of about 15nM at CB1 and 51nM at CB2. It&amp;#39;s noted for having high COVID-19 3C-like protease inhibitor activity in studies evaluated on a select group of cannabinoids. Delta-8-THCB has a binding affinity of 65nM at CB1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THCH (Tetrahydrocannabihexol)&lt;/strong&gt; (THC-Hexyl / THC-C6) is structurally related to THC except with THCs Pentyl tailchain extended to Hexyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THCA (Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid)&lt;/strong&gt; (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THC-O-ACETATE) is the primary naturally occurring cannabinoid in psychoactive Cannabis. When Cannabis flower is smoked or vaped the heat converts THCA into D9-THC to provide the effects. THCA itself does not bind to the cannabinoid receptors without first being converted into D9-THC but is a COX 1 and 2 inhibitor and FAAH enzyme inhibitor and Anandamide transporter and a TRPV1 and TRPV2 agonist suggesting anti-inflammatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta-10-THC&lt;/strong&gt; and Delta-6a10a-THC (see the above list)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THC-O-Acetate&lt;/strong&gt; is structurally related to THC except with an acetyl group attached to THCs hydroxy group, like other THC esters it&amp;#39;s believed to function as a prodrug to THC. It&amp;#39;s important to note that there is both Delta-8-THC-O-Acetate as well as Delta-9-THC-O-Acetate. There is typically a delay in effect before full effects are felt, possibly due to the deacetylation process in the body to remove the acetyl group so the free THC can produce an effect. Unlike some other drugs such as Salicylic acid or Morphine, THC only seems a limited boost in bioavailability because it is already very lipophilic but it&amp;#39;s been hypothesized to have higher oral (by mouth/edible) bioavailability but this has not been proven as of January 2023. THC-O-Acetate has sometimes been marketed as 3x stronger than THC but this is seemingly based off a single study in dogs where it produced 2.5x sedation that have not been followed up on. In 1974 it was described in the popular book Cannabis Alchemy as being &amp;quot;more spiritual and psychedelic&amp;quot; although this has been disputed by many users. It&amp;#39;s been suggested by some that in the 1970s the CB receptors were not discovered yet and THC was promoted as being an &amp;quot;atypical hallucinogen&amp;quot; which may of had influence. Most users seem to agree that THC-O-Acetate feels like it overall lasts longer than THC. Most other acetylated cannabinoids seem to follow this trend. A more definitive user-survey based study has been conducted and is currently being compiled and will be linked here when published that hopes to show more into user reported experiences with (D8 and D9) THC-O-Acetate and it&amp;#39;s comparison to (D8 and D9) THC itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBG (Cannabigerol)&lt;/strong&gt; is sometimes called &amp;quot;the mother cannabinoid&amp;quot; since a majority of phytocannabinoids are biosynthesized from CBGA in the plant. There are various high (10%+) CBGA hemp strains and can be derived from the Cannabis plant via various extraction methods. CBG is a strong alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and moderate 5HT1A antagonist. Studies have suggested it to be a weak agonist and antagonist with a binding affinity of 896nM at CB1 and 153nM at CB2. Studies suggest CBG may quickly metabolize into Cyclo-CBG (cyclo not to be confused with cyclohexyl).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabichromene (CBC)&lt;/strong&gt; (cannanbichromene /  cannabinochromene) is a benzopyran based cannabinoid. CBC is typically considered non-psychoactive by most studies and user reports although some disagree. At least one in vitro study puts CBCs binding affinity of 713nM at CB1 and 256nM at CB2 and reports it&amp;#39;s unknown what type of activity it has on the receptor, past studies have put the binding at under 1,000nM. CBC is a TRPV1 and TRPV1A agonist. Its antinociception activity has been suggested to be unrelated to its CB1/CB2 action as demonstrated by a study with an antagonist. It may enhance the antinociception and antiinflammatory effects of THC in vitro. CBC lowers glutathione levels in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabicitran (CBT)&lt;/strong&gt; not to be confused with Cannabitriol which is also sometimes called CBT. As of January 2023 it seems only Cannabicitran is marketed as CBT at this point in time. Cannabicitran is a benzopyran based cannabinoid structurally similar to THC. It&amp;#39;s believed to be non-psychoactive and a NAGly (GPR18) agonist known to reduce intraocular pressure although does not bind to it as high as THC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta-Caryophyllene (BCP)&lt;/strong&gt; is a terpene structurally unrelated to THC, CBD and other classical cannabinoids that acts as a full agonist of the CB2 receptor with an affinity of about 126nM and no activity at CB1. It can be found naturally within Cannabis among several other plants and foods. It should be noted that Caryophyllene oxide is not known to act on the cannabinoid receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&amp;quot;Spice&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;K2&amp;quot; noids vs these cannabinoids--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cannabinoids that went into synthetic blends like &amp;quot;Spice&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;K2&amp;quot; are structurally unrelated to the cannabinoids in cannabis, there is newer research linked &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalCannabinoids/comments/rz2h8f/study_aminoalkylindoles_bind_to_a_second_site/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalCannabinoids/comments/rz2d1f/study_there_is_some_evidence_that_the_indoles/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that suggests because those cannabinoids are so structurally different that they can interact with different subtypes inside of the CB1 (and CB2) receptor that &amp;quot;classical cannabinoids&amp;quot; (analogs of THC and CBD) may not be able to interact with among other hypothesis to contribution such as aromatic stacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structurally this difference is clear, &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/hvM1Ndg""&gt;here is an example&lt;/a&gt; of &amp;quot;classical cannabinoids&amp;quot; (analogs of THC and CBD), and &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/kGvMM6h""&gt;here is an example&lt;/a&gt; of some indole and indazole core noids that went into some &amp;quot;spice/k2&amp;quot; blends. Here is another visual example of this difference &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/6d21TpF""&gt;https://imgur.com/6d21TpF&lt;/a&gt;  The noids that went into spice/k2 are so different that we do not allow their open discussion on this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---What defines an altnoid---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what Urban Dictionary claims there is none, this subreddit is for discussion of cannabinoids and and are alt to the cannabinoid subreddit as in the name was already taken as opposed to something else but the term &amp;quot;altnoids&amp;quot; has been used to describe Delta-8-THC, HHC, CBN and basically every other cannabinoid besides THC online but this is doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense, they are just cannabinoids. This subreddit is dedicated to discussion of cannabinoids that have been found within or derived from compounds found within Cannabis, we allow discussion of all classical cannabinoids (analogs of THC and CBD) as well as discussion of cannabinoids found in other plants and fungi.&lt;/p&gt;

Is there any reason to believe that doing this to our favorite altnoids molecules would produce psychoactive noids as well or are there larger scale considerations that would cause them to be inactive (or toxic)?

"with any of those we ingest there will be docking sequences whereby the compound will engage with the human cell and effect change  ...  the compound is three d structure so has differences from one side to another ( up, down, left , right ) and when the cell takes it in the compounds could be upside down , right side up, left side , right side dominant effecting over all effects in a minor way ..  this is -Chirality 

too and a huge part of this  -  Lipid Rafts  ( Cellular back cross talk ) that provide further expression as each compound molecule makes it through the persons cellular anatomy and all of the cells communicating with one another in the endocannabinoid system.

take the Famous and controversial Marinol THC synthetic drug as an example.

"this LA Times article (archive link) talks about how extract is being made by the big producers w/ no concerns about where the trim or moldy flower is coming from or what pesticides it might contain.

It also talks about how the industry uses pesticides that aren't on the required-testing list. 

Also talks about how the industry knows which test labs don't really test for heavy metals, etc. 

So I'm assuming the legal hemp (delta 8) industry uses heavy pesticides. Safe bet?

"it's possible but most of these producers of actual distillate products are themselves using isolate products as the starting product. These are legitimate laboratories creating these products, using proper procedure. The chemical conversion process of CBD -&gt; Delta-8-THC &amp; others is too expensive on a small scale to be reasonable to clandestine, though it does still happen sometimes. The big producers are using CBD **isolate** for the starting material. 

CBD isolate usually doesn't have the same issues as things like rosin, shatter, or ""live"" extracts, because it's a more specific extraction process. They're selecting specifically for CBD itself, whereas with the aforementioned, it's a much more general extraction either with heat, butane, or co2, and it's not further refined besides through physical means (like sorting out THCa crystals). So it should be significantly cleaner to start. So the real problems in terms of contaminates are just byproducts of manufacture itself, things leftover from the process of conversion.

However, that's just for distillate products. For products that are using flower, like the pre-rolls and the flower (THCa, and sprayed flowers) might still have a risk. CBD rosin/live extracts that aren't isolated might also have the same issue. If you stick to distillate products from legitimate manufacturers (i'd list some if i could source), and not just shitty ghost brands like Cake or something super flashy then you most likely won't have many contaminants. 

A lot of the stuff posted here as like ""is this good?"" is stuff I honestly wouldn't purchase personally lol. That Super Looper one looks sketchy as hell, for example.

"COVID-19 (the virus itself) contains a protease enzyme which COVID uses to replicate and spread in the body. If the enzyme (in COVID) is inhibited then COVID has a hard time surviving because it cant replicate as easily or at all giving your body a better chance to fight it off.

Paxlovid (the COVID treatment pill by Pfizer) primarily works as a protease inhibitor of COVIDs enzyme but off the top of my head I forget it's values. In the study I can recall they tested a few different phytocannabinoids against GV376 (antiviral protease inhibitor drug) and GV376 has a inhibition rate of almost 99% while THC-Butyl was found to be around 80% which was the highest of any of the cannabinoids tested in the study (11-OH-THC one of the metabolites of THC coming in 2nd at around 55%) so I wonder if 11-OH-THC-Butyl would have any higher effect.

"I recently bought a cart from a company I trust (for the most part) at least when it comes to open and full panel cannabinoid lab tests that match the numbers I get on my carts ie batch number or testing number. It’s Delta Extrax, which I’ve now heard used to be somewhat sketchier in certain regards. I’m a chemist working for a corporate dispensary/smart shop company and do rough QA/QC as well as use these products myself. Background is in organic synthesis and drug crystallography and purification. 

Cutting to the chase b4 my ADHD ruins my post: I got a cart that reportedly had 9(R) + 9(S) -THD forms with majority 9(R) since most of the R isomers are more psychoactive. WHAT IS THD??? Am I dumb and it’s a CBD analogue or did they make something up for the machine to read an indole as? 

Concerning the ‘THD’ containing cart, it also has some other alt noids that are know to be good. I’ll post the COA on a separate post and the product. 

So far it feels good, activates my tinnitus/was overstimulating for my ADHD (“hearing electricity”) but high THCV flower do that to me as well as my stimulant medications so no cause for alarm. I’m about 20 minutes into taking three hits at 3.7V as to not waste any noids and I preheated and mixed the cart thoroughly before priming and using. 
Since this does not feel bad or even that strange, just a tad more visual with brighter colors akin to D9-THC-O and also a kind of blurry vision I associate with indica/HHC or maybe post dab coughing haha. 

Anyone heard of a cannabinoid called THD or have any insight into what the chemical name would be if this is indeed a tetra noid and not an indole or if it’s a CBD analogue?

TL;DR Any and all info and speculation on what THD is  would be welcome 🙏 also this cart was 20$ for 2g cause of discounts and is 38% D8 mixed with live resin base so if it ends up being a fake toxin or shitty indole I will gladly throw it out and make a larger post about it 👍 if you are a chemist who had encountered this molecule please post some links!!

&lt;p&gt;Cutting to the chase b4 my ADHD ruins my post: I got a cart that reportedly had 9(R) + 9(S) -THD forms with majority 9(R) since most of the R isomers are more psychoactive. WHAT IS THD??? Am I dumb and it’s a CBD analogue or did they make something up for the machine to read an indole as? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning the ‘THD’ containing cart, it also has some other alt noids that are know to be good. I’ll post the COA on a separate post and the product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far it feels good, activates my tinnitus/was overstimulating for my ADHD (“hearing electricity”) but high THCV flower do that to me as well as my stimulant medications so no cause for alarm. I’m about 20 minutes into taking three hits at 3.7V as to not waste any noids and I preheated and mixed the cart thoroughly before priming and using. 
Since this does not feel bad or even that strange, just a tad more visual with brighter colors akin to D9-THC-O and also a kind of blurry vision I associate with indica/HHC or maybe post dab coughing haha. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone heard of a cannabinoid called THD or have any insight into what the chemical name would be if this is indeed a tetra noid and not an indole or if it’s a CBD analogue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Any and all info and speculation on what THD is  would be welcome 🙏 also this cart was 20$ for 2g cause of discounts and is 38% D8 mixed with live resin base so if it ends up being a fake toxin or shitty indole I will gladly throw it out and make a larger post about it 👍 if you are a chemist who had encountered this molecule please post some links!! Love the open info sharing 💜🌀🔥&lt;/p&gt;

"&gt;What is this measurement for receptor binding - ""nM""?  


Stands for nanomolar, way of measuring dissociation constant for binding affnity, the lower the number is higher the binding (0.1nM binds higher than 1nM binds higher than 10nM)

&gt;What is the difference between CB1 and CB2 receptors?  


The CB1 receptor is what's responsible for psychoactive effects while the CB2 receptor does not but both have many medical benefits mediated through their receptor but CB2 is more known as being related to immune function and more activity in the peripheral nervous system than central nervous system.

&gt;What is a prodrug?  


A prodrug is a substance that's typically inactive/lacks significant activity and turns into another drug that is active/has desired activity. But the term can also be used for drugs that have activity themselves but turn into another drug. In the case of THC-O-Acetate the body internally removes the acetyl group after consumption and the free THC goes to work as it normally would.","altcannabinoids","r/altcannabinoids","2023-01-25T04:09:20.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

"I’ve been using this D9&amp;CBD vape for a few months now. I’m in Tennessee, so real weed is illegal, but D8 and D9 are legal as long as they come from hemp rather than cannabis. So anyway, I’ve been using this vape for a good while now with no problems. It’s from a pretty legit store too. It’s not one of those sketchy stores that sells all the legal “drugs” in one place. Like there’s a store near me that sells D8, D9, pipes, rolling papers, and other unregulated stuff like Kratom too. But the vape I have is from a classy place with only the fancy hemp stuff like gummies and real vapes.

But yeah. I was almost done with the vape, only a small droplet of juice left in the pen. I took a hit and everything is fine. I got high, ate some chips, and went to bed. No big deal. About a half hour later, I wake up, and my smart watch tells me my pulse is abnormally high, just over 130 bpm. I take a deep breath, my pulse goes down, and then I go back to sleep.

Another 30ish minutes go by, I wake up again with the same message. But this time it’s worse. My pulse keeps going up and up, to above 150. I can literally feel my heart beating out of my chest. I can hear it beating in my head, and my limbs are super stiff. I’m freaking out. I take a deep breath again, and it doesn’t help this time. I get up and walk around, and that doesn’t help. I feel like I’m having a heart attack, if I knew that felt like. So I call 911.

The ambulance picks me up, and the EMT doesn’t seem too concerned. Apparently he’s dealt with this many times before. “Your blood pressure is normal. You’re fine. You may just have to be miserable for the next few hours,” he said.

Once I got to the ER, they basically say the same thing. They said they’d give me an EKG, but they didn’t. They seemed actually a bit dismissive.

Anyway, I woke up feeling pretty normal and went home.

Has this ever happened to anyone, and if so, is it unique to vaping, or has it happened from smoking and/or edibles too? Or does it have to do with delta-9 as opposed to real weed?

I saw something on Google about this happening if you use weed every day after building up a tolerance. But I use my vape maybe once a week. Sometimes less than that. Nowhere near daily.

I’d appreciate any constructive feedback.

"they probably arent as strong as labeled. but on the off chance they are, take like a fifth of one gummy.

first time cannabis users probably take 5-10mg of an edible dose of d9.

again, the pack is probably weaker than labeled, but on the off chance it's accurate, eating a whole one is gonna be a lot to handle. You'd be fine, of course, but 100mg is definitely not a first time dose. i would say neither is 50. you definitely want to take less than a quarter of the gummy and see how you feel, wait a couple of hours, then assess and move up in dosage from there. you can always get more if you under dose or if they are weak, but you can never cancel out the high once you've cashed the check, so to speak.","altcannabinoids","r/altcannabinoids","2024-06-17T17:29:33.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;they probably arent as strong as labeled. but on the off chance they are, take like a fifth of one gummy.&lt;/p&gt;

Delta 9o when smoked goes to your liver and has the acetate sliced off and the delta 9 sent on its way to your brain in a more bioavailable formate. I'm curious about what happens when you EAT delta 9 acetate. I'm not a fan of delta 11 from edibles but I do like just delta 9 how ever I'm not a fan of smoking due to the health risks. So far the only thing I've found that could potentially do that is d9o. I can't purchase a tincture with the same amount of THC from a vape and for the same amount it would likely be damn near 10 times the cost. However I can purchase about 3000 mg of d9o for about 25 bucks. This would both solve any health risks from smoking and as well as save me money, plus I find the urge to use again is easier to manage with edibles then a vape
What do I do here?

"You'll be okay just stop smoking it. Got burnt. Could be the battery you are using, I would guess voltage. 

As for your health. 

I've been apart of the hemp industry from it's formation. There is a lot of shady things happening in this grey market.   
Good example, the testing you're looking at. Yeah the labs are corrupt. They are incentivized to approve your product as they are less watched. Even if it's a better lab like ACS or KCA, who's to say what's in your cart matches that COA? 

So many times we did our own testing on something sent with it's own testing and got completely different results. Like half the time. 

Oh not to mention HHC is synthetic and we have nooooo testing on the effects it has vs normal THC which we have a loooooot more experience with.

"Little shop down the road from my house has a bunch of cool shit. Ive been trying a few things here and there. 

Before I go further lemme preface(for the head asses) that I love the reputable vendors, and i make my own edibles too. I dont regularly use altnoids and mostly smoke flower, but once in a while I like to treat my broken back to a wild time. I also just like going out on limbs and trying some of this sketchy looking shit.

Anyway, they got these new ones in. Ive never heard of Flying Horse before, and They seem to have more vape products than anything. This shop had some gummies, and a few prerolls though. These little packs were like 5$ a piece for this comedically huge fuckin gummies lol 

Scourged the net for COA and didnt find shit. I might not have looked hard enough but usually i can find a COA pretty easily with google, such is life. 

I just ate both packs. They taste like distillate flavor, plus a bit of weed flavor which is new to me. Most shop gummies dont ever taste like weed. Could just be added terps or something. The birthdaycake was great and tastes like legit cake icing lol. Kinda neat and delicious.

Who knows if there is really 1,200mg per gummy?

"&gt;Large doses of cbd CAN reduce a high but potentiates at lower doses. 

This is incorrect, at least when eating it. 

[https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2023/02/cbd-may-increase-the-adverse-effects-of-thc-in-edible-cannabis-products-study-shows](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2023/02/cbd-may-increase-the-adverse-effects-of-thc-in-edible-cannabis-products-study-shows)  


&gt;Contrary to some common claims, a study led by Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers found that relatively high doses of cannabidiol (CBD) may increase the adverse effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active ingredient in cannabis that can cause a mood alteration or a “high” sensation. The finding show that in edible cannabis products, CBD inhibits the metabolism, or breakdown, of THC, which may result in stronger and longer drug effects.  
The results of the study, published Feb. 13 in JAMA Network Open, found that the maximum amount of THC measured in participants’ blood samples was almost twice as high after consuming a brownie containing THC with CBD than after eating a brownie with only THC, even though the dose of THC in each brownie (20 mg) was the same. In addition, the maximum amount of 11-OH-THC (a metabolic byproduct of THC that produces drug effects similar to THC) was 10-fold greater after eating the brownie with the high CBD extract compared with the one containing high THC extract.","altcannabinoids","r/altcannabinoids","2024-06-16T19:53:11.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large doses of cbd CAN reduce a high but potentiates at lower doses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is incorrect, at least when eating it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2023/02/cbd-may-increase-the-adverse-effects-of-thc-in-edible-cannabis-products-study-shows""&gt;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2023/02/cbd-may-increase-the-adverse-effects-of-thc-in-edible-cannabis-products-study-shows&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to some common claims, a study led by Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers found that relatively high doses of cannabidiol (CBD) may increase the adverse effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active ingredient in cannabis that can cause a mood alteration or a “high” sensation. The finding show that in edible cannabis products, CBD inhibits the metabolism, or breakdown, of THC, which may result in stronger and longer drug effects.&lt;br/&gt;
The results of the study, published Feb. 13 in JAMA Network Open, found that the maximum amount of THC measured in participants’ blood samples was almost twice as high after consuming a brownie containing THC with CBD than after eating a brownie with only THC, even though the dose of THC in each brownie (20 mg) was the same.

"I recently got in a pack of samples from Canna Crunchers CBD and part of those samples included what they called a ""DIY kit"". It included small samples of several ingredients you could use to make your own formulations or vapes. I thought it was a pretty cool idea and figured it might be helpful to write up my thoughts on what was included for anyone who's looking to get into mixing up their own products. The kit included some HTE (high terpene extract) infused distillate (which I will cover in a separate review and won't talk much about here), some CBN, CBD, and THCa isolate powder, some terpenes, and two empty carts. I'll take each of those and explain them a little bit more along with how they might be used.


Carts - If you want to fill your own carts you have to start with the hardware. There are lots of different options out there for cart hardware. One of my favorite to use is PCKT brand, but I've tried several. Canna Crunchers included one of each of their empty 1g carts, a metal one and a ceramic one. Both carts have typical flat/round mouthpieces that screw on after the cart is filled. Since they screw on/off rather than snap on they could be refilled once empty, which is always nice. The metal one is slightly shorter due to the fact that the rod in it is thinner. The ceramic one has a thicker rod, therefore it's taller to still accommodate 1g of oil. They both have nice big intake holes for the coils and have worked well so far (I filled them both with HTE infused distillate). You can fill them easily using a glass syringe (preferably with metal plunger) and luer lock needle tip. I heat up the carts, syringe, and disty on a candle warmer and once they are all toasty and the disty has a water like consistency I just use the syringe to fill the cart up to the top and screw on the cap. Since everything is warm it flows smoothly and wicks quickly and the carts are usually ready to go right away.


Isolate Powders - Isolate powders are extremely refined/pure forms of cannabinoid that are usually a fine white powder with very little if any taste or smell to them. They could be mixed into other things like distillate or resin/rosin if desired to alter or enhance the effects, or they can easily be mixed with MCT oil (or other type of oil) to make a tincture. They could also be baked into edibles for that matter. If mixing into distillate heat would probably be required to help melt down the isolate and get it to incorporate into the distillate and you would probably also need to add terps or some other sort of thinner to keep the final consistency from being too thick to work well in a vape cart if that is your desired end result. Each isolate has it's own characteristics it brings to the table.


CBD - This one needs very little introduction. While it's not psychoactive (doesn't get you high) it can add a little bit of a different dimension to distillate by giving it a more relaxing and calming aspect to it. I prefer a little bit of CBD in my vapes as it rounds it out in my opinion and makes it more enjoyable.


CBN - This one is very mildly psychoactive, but I wouldn't expect it to really get you high on its own unless you were taking a quite large dose. It does tend to help with sleep though, so if you are looking to make something for nighttime, CBN is a great go to. To me it feels pretty heavy and can make me quite sleepy if there's enough of it. I would probably mix this into a vape at around 10% or so to give it a little more of that couch lock sleepy feel if that's what you're after.


THCa - In it's original powdered form THCa isolate shouldn't be psychoactive, but when heated it decarbs and converts into psychoactive THC. With that in mind, if that's what your after this one should probably be reserved for vape or dabbing uses. You could also make tinctures or edibles with it, but it wouldn't have the same psychoactive effects that it would if heated.


Terpenes - If you are using distillate and/or isolate powders to make a vape you are definitely going to want some flavoring of some sort as without it your vape would taste pretty much like nothing (unless that's what you're into, in which case go for it!). Terps come in a few different types. There are BDT (botanical derived terpenes) that usually are sweeter and fruitier and can taste a little artificial or be harsh if they aren't high quality. There are CDT and HDT (cannabis and hemp derived terpenes) that usually have flavor profiles that are more natural and closer to that of flower. And finally, there are HTE (high terpene extracts) that are high in terpenes, but also include other cannabinoids for a fuller experience. The terpene sample that Canna Crunchers included was a sample of their CO2 extracted Lemon Thai cannabis derived terpenes (CDT). As far as regular terps go, CO2 extracted CDT are usually the highest quality around. They are quite strong smelling as you can imagine. This one has a really nice citrusy and fresh lemon scent with earthy, herbal, and a little skunky undertones. It smells really natural and I am looking forward to using them in the future to make some vape cartridges. With terps a little goes a long way, you usually want to shoot for around 5-7% terps with your mixes. Terps are very watery as well so they help thin out mixes depending on how much you use.


Hopefully some of the info in this write up was helpful. Making your own mixes and vape cartridges can be intimidating, but it's really not a hard or complicated process and can definitely save you some money in the long run, as well as allow you to fine tune the effects you want.

"Already know how it works , but just wanna say thanks for the effort by typing this post for others who don’t.

And would like to add.
If you use snap-cap carts instead of threaded heads , just warm up the cart a bit so the medium softens at the seal then take a small ikea like scissors and clamp the tip between the cap and glass and 360 around it (you’ll fuck the seal but seals back after medium is hard again after filling.)and then just move the scissor forward while gently clamping it and the cap snaps right off instead off breaking the glass.

Good for a 6/7 refill depending on the noid blend , after that ethanol wash your carts for reuse.

So yes for some of us it’s worth it as we see it as a hobby and not a time consuming thing.

Most of us make larger batch blends and fill multiple carts for storage , so in a our our so I make a large batch blend and fill about 20 carts in another our , after that the blend is already made and takes about half an hour to refill 10carts to sit.

For far less money then a dispo or cart.

"Dude asked you to end it with a respectful disagreement, you come back with assumptions and judgements about his consumption.  Then say you respect the hobby, as if anyone in the thread cant see that you obviously already have a negative view of it.

Ill chime in with another perspective, I think yall buying premade carts are straight rubes, buying who knows what poop soup for a ridiculous markup, making some grungy company packing carts out of some dusty warehouse - doing the same thing we are talking about in this thread just at scale - rich as fuck off your ignorance and lack of gumption to take a minute to learn about the process, source some trusted vendors and make your own.

Plus its fun to save money and hook up friends and family.  I normally smoke flower but I like to have a cart here and there when say a vacation comes up and im gonna be away from home for awhile.  Use to be, when something like that came up, I had to budget an extra couple hundred bucks to buy 4 half gram carts at 50 dollars a piece.

So one day I said, Im gonna look at how to make my own, spent that same 200 bucks on some supplies and got myself enough stuff to make 15 full 1 gram carts - and this stuff doesnt oxidize like flower does so its gonna last forever - nice little stash put back in a little box, taking up hardly any space on a little shelf under my desk - and now the next time I need to get away, I dont have to worry about buying carts from the dispo or sourcing something wherever I am.

Added bonus I ended up buying more distillate because I have actually saved money, and have been able to make very potent canna caps, and those are put away in the freezer, so now I have edibles if I ever need to consume in a place thats not flower or vape friendly.

And remember, friend, that this stuff is medicine for a lot of people.  You are very transparently judgemental, which is a weird to me, but I remind myself, you are the type of rube that gives some scumbag making carts in his garage your money while talking down on people learning to make their own.

"I recently got in a pack of samples from Canna Crunchers CBD and part of those samples included what they called a ""DIY kit"". It included small samples of several ingredients you could use to make your own formulations or vapes. I thought it was a pretty cool idea and figured it might be helpful to write up my thoughts on what was included for anyone who's looking to get into mixing up their own products. The kit included some HTE (high terpene extract) infused distillate (which I will cover in a separate review and won't talk much about here), some CBN, CBD, and THCa isolate powder, some terpenes, and two empty carts. I'll take each of those and explain them a little bit more along with how they might be used.


Carts - If you want to fill your own carts you have to start with the hardware. There are lots of different options out there for cart hardware. One of my favorite to use is PCKT brand, but I've tried several. Canna Crunchers included one of each of their empty 1g carts, a metal one and a ceramic one. Both carts have typical flat/round mouthpieces that screw on after the cart is filled. Since they screw on/off rather than snap on they could be refilled once empty, which is always nice. The metal one is slightly shorter due to the fact that the rod in it is thinner. The ceramic one has a thicker rod, therefore it's taller to still accommodate 1g of oil. They both have nice big intake holes for the coils and have worked well so far (I filled them both with HTE infused distillate). You can fill them easily using a glass syringe (preferably with metal plunger) and luer lock needle tip. I heat up the carts, syringe, and disty on a candle warmer and once they are all toasty and the disty has a water like consistency I just use the syringe to fill the cart up to the top and screw on the cap. Since everything is warm it flows smoothly and wicks quickly and the carts are usually ready to go right away.


Isolate Powders - Isolate powders are extremely refined/pure forms of cannabinoid that are usually a fine white powder with very little if any taste or smell to them. They could be mixed into other things like distillate or resin/rosin if desired to alter or enhance the effects, or they can easily be mixed with MCT oil (or other type of oil) to make a tincture. They could also be baked into edibles for that matter. If mixing into distillate heat would probably be required to help melt down the isolate and get it to incorporate into the distillate and you would probably also need to add terps or some other sort of thinner to keep the final consistency from being too thick to work well in a vape cart if that is your desired end result. Each isolate has it's own characteristics it brings to the table.


CBD - This one needs very little introduction. While it's not psychoactive (doesn't get you high) it can add a little bit of a different dimension to distillate by giving it a more relaxing and calming aspect to it. I prefer a little bit of CBD in my vapes as it rounds it out in my opinion and makes it more enjoyable.


CBN - This one is very mildly psychoactive, but I wouldn't expect it to really get you high on its own unless you were taking a quite large dose. It does tend to help with sleep though, so if you are looking to make something for nighttime, CBN is a great go to. To me it feels pretty heavy and can make me quite sleepy if there's enough of it. I would probably mix this into a vape at around 10% or so to give it a little more of that couch lock sleepy feel if that's what you're after.


THCa - In it's original powdered form THCa isolate shouldn't be psychoactive, but when heated it decarbs and converts into psychoactive THC. With that in mind, if that's what your after this one should probably be reserved for vape or dabbing uses. You could also make tinctures or edibles with it, but it wouldn't have the same psychoactive effects that it would if heated.


Terpenes - If you are using distillate and/or isolate powders to make a vape you are definitely going to want some flavoring of some sort as without it your vape would taste pretty much like nothing (unless that's what you're into, in which case go for it!). Terps come in a few different types. There are BDT (botanical derived terpenes) that usually are sweeter and fruitier and can taste a little artificial or be harsh if they aren't high quality. There are CDT and HDT (cannabis and hemp derived terpenes) that usually have flavor profiles that are more natural and closer to that of flower. And finally, there are HTE (high terpene extracts) that are high in terpenes, but also include other cannabinoids for a fuller experience. The terpene sample that Canna Crunchers included was a sample of their CO2 extracted Lemon Thai cannabis derived terpenes (CDT). As far as regular terps go, CO2 extracted CDT are usually the highest quality around. They are quite strong smelling as you can imagine. This one has a really nice citrusy and fresh lemon scent with earthy, herbal, and a little skunky undertones. It smells really natural and I am looking forward to using them in the future to make some vape cartridges. With terps a little goes a long way, you usually want to shoot for around 5-7% terps with your mixes. Terps are very watery as well so they help thin out mixes depending on how much you use.


Hopefully some of the info in this write up was helpful. Making your own mixes and vape cartridges can be intimidating, but it's really not a hard or complicated process and can definitely save you some money in the long run, as well as allow you to fine tune the effects you want.

"Already know how it works , but just wanna say thanks for the effort by typing this post for others who don’t.

And would like to add.
If you use snap-cap carts instead of threaded heads , just warm up the cart a bit so the medium softens at the seal then take a small ikea like scissors and clamp the tip between the cap and glass and 360 around it (you’ll fuck the seal but seals back after medium is hard again after filling.)and then just move the scissor forward while gently clamping it and the cap snaps right off instead off breaking the glass.

Good for a 6/7 refill depending on the noid blend , after that ethanol wash your carts for reuse.

So yes for some of us it’s worth it as we see it as a hobby and not a time consuming thing.

Most of us make larger batch blends and fill multiple carts for storage , so in a our our so I make a large batch blend and fill about 20 carts in another our , after that the blend is already made and takes about half an hour to refill 10carts to sit.

For far less money then a dispo or cart.

"It's a trap my friend and you will end up consuming more than you wanted or needed actually. Plus having jars of staff it is space consuming too.

"Dude asked you to end it with a respectful disagreement, you come back with assumptions and judgements about his consumption.  Then say you respect the hobby, as if anyone in the thread cant see that you obviously already have a negative view of it.

Ill chime in with another perspective, I think yall buying premade carts are straight rubes, buying who knows what poop soup for a ridiculous markup, making some grungy company packing carts out of some dusty warehouse - doing the same thing we are talking about in this thread just at scale - rich as fuck off your ignorance and lack of gumption to take a minute to learn about the process, source some trusted vendors and make your own.

Plus its fun to save money and hook up friends and family.  I normally smoke flower but I like to have a cart here and there when say a vacation comes up and im gonna be away from home for awhile.  Use to be, when something like that came up, I had to budget an extra couple hundred bucks to buy 4 half gram carts at 50 dollars a piece.

So one day I said, Im gonna look at how to make my own, spent that same 200 bucks on some supplies and got myself enough stuff to make 15 full 1 gram carts - and this stuff doesnt oxidize like flower does so its gonna last forever - nice little stash put back in a little box, taking up hardly any space on a little shelf under my desk - and now the next time I need to get away, I dont have to worry about buying carts from the dispo or sourcing something wherever I am.

Added bonus I ended up buying more distillate because I have actually saved money, and have been able to make very potent canna caps, and those are put away in the freezer, so now I have edibles if I ever need to consume in a place thats not flower or vape friendly.

And remember, friend, that this stuff is medicine for a lot of people.  You are very transparently judgemental, which is a weird to me, but I remind myself, you are the type of rube that gives some scumbag making carts in his garage your money while talking down on people learning to make their own.

"Hey all. I've posted about making fully water soluble and fast acting cannabinoids before, but I think I have my recipe dialed in pretty dang perfect now.

I wanted to have 100 mg/ml (1 dropperful), with taste that would disappear, and hopefully be fast acting.

I started using polyorbate 80 recently and I posted a video showing the technique--here is that video-

https://youtu.be/Hu25PxMnYkM?si=YcgyZznXsIGxRjXk
-the technique is solid but here is the new recipe I recommend

First of all know I have to make at least 4 fluid ounces because my mixer has to have at least that much liquid to work effectively. If your mixer is smaller you could make less.

So I'm going for 100mg cannabinoids per each ml of liquid (one dropperful) so I have to start out with some math

So-4 ounces is 120 ml and I want each ml to have 100 mg of cannabinoids, so I need 1200 mg (12 grams of pure distillate-more if it is less pure)

I want an equal amount of oil as my distillate--I have switched to MCT oil (from coconut oil) for this purpose I believe the thinner liquid at room temp nature of it is helpful.

We then have to figure out how much polysorbate 80--appx .5% of your total recipe is what I had read, but I based my calculations on using 1:1 water--so about 50 grams total, so I was going for about 1/4 of a gram (but ended up with more like 1/3--is ok).

So since my distillate &amp; oil are 24 grams, got 3 1/4 ~~cups~~ ounces of hot (not quite boiling) water ready and in my mixer. Pour my warmed and blended distillate/oil mix &amp; the polysorbate in the mixer and let it blend on high for about 15 minutes.

The result is a thin milky looking liquid that after sitting has a very slight ""oil slick"" look on top, but doesn't seem to want to separate even after sitting overnight.

I tried it out in a N/A beer and it dissolved right away and I couldn't taste it. I also tried it in a small glass of milk (where it should be more obvious) and I couldn't taste it there either, so it should disappear in most everything.

1200 mg worth of distillate, RSO, or activated concentrate 12 grams of MCT oil 1/4-1/3 gram poly sorbate 80 3 1/4 ~~cups~~ounces hot water

This recipe makes each 1ml dropperful appx 100 mg and each drop appx 5 mg. For many people making it half as strong would make a lot of sense--just cut the distillate, oil, and PS80 in half and increase the water by about 12 grams and you'll be good to go.

"Drinking alcohol makes me puke smelling it turns my stomach but like I said make the tincture strong and you can make it so you only need a drop or two or if you get a metered/ measured eye dropper with marking like .1ml to 1ml in .1ml increments and you can drop just .1ml and take a sip of water the taste will go right away. When made with good flower the flower taste really does a lot to help make the alcohol taste and smell less poison and more palatable even tasty sometimes just a sting to it, I’d say the burn/ sting is a bigger bleh then the small amount of alcohol and everclear doesn’t have much a taste anyways it’s just like super spicy water plainest of plain more so than even vodka oddly to me. But if your that worried just mix it into a drink, whatever food you may be eating, or on a sour patch kid or something and let the alc evap off &lt;3. 

If not willing to do any of that the internet has plenty of guides to make canna butter or sugar I usually only do tincture but I’ve made butter before not hard just extra work, less portable, has to be put into a dish as opposed to being able to take it whenever via dropper, and more math.

Oh wait I suppose one could make a mct oil tincture!!!!! I’m almost sure that’s a thing I don’t know the process as I haven’t made it probablt similar to alc tincture but probably requires some heat and some more agitation maybe (please look up a guide if going this route as I’m not 100% as I haven’t done it) there’s also propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin the second I think would be better but I feel that may be a option but I’d imagine mct is safer being natural and all. Where pg and vg is the base for vape juice liquid so must be sage enough to vape and consume but once again not sure on this even less sure than the mct idea.

Best of luck you can do this!","altcannabinoids","r/altcannabinoids","2024-06-15T14:19:15.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol makes me puke smelling it turns my stomach but like I said make the tincture strong and you can make it so you only need a drop or two or if you get a metered/ measured eye dropper with marking like .1ml to 1ml in .1ml increments and you can drop just .1ml and take a sip of water the taste will go right away. When made with good flower the flower taste really does a lot to help make the alcohol taste and smell less poison and more palatable even tasty sometimes just a sting to it, I’d say the burn/ sting is a bigger bleh then the small amount of alcohol and everclear doesn’t have much a taste anyways it’s just like super spicy water plainest of plain more so than even vodka oddly to me. But if your that worried just mix it into a drink, whatever food you may be eating, or on a sour patch kid or something and let the alc evap off &amp;lt;3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not willing to do any of that the internet has plenty of guides to make canna butter or sugar I usually only do tincture but I’ve made butter before not hard just extra work, less portable, has to be put into a dish as opposed to being able to take it whenever via dropper, and more math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait I suppose one could make a mct oil tincture!!!!!

"The problem is Gilded doesn't test what they sell. If you look at the COAs, they are supplier coas that don't match what Gilded is selling. There's no way a distillate manufacturer like HAU is still selling distillate they made in August 2023, meaning what you're getting hasnt been tested.

They also dont test any of the blends they make in house, which is concerning considering you dont know if youre actually getting whats advertised or that there weren't any contaminants that got in during the blending process. They dont test any of their hardware which should be tested for heavy metals. They dont have any licenses in texas meaning the blending process is likely not in a sterile environment which makes it more concerning that they dont test anything.

"Not trying to be rude but you’re incorrect. 
If you vape thc-p, hhc-p etc. it will last 24hrs. You haven’t vaped straight thcp or hhcp if you don’t understand this, which is probably a good thing it’s very strong. You need to set out at least 24hrs to do nothing if you use these noids undiluted and sometimes even if they are diluted. Be very careful with these -p cannabinoids. 
They are great medicine but you only need a little bit. If you dab or vape one of these undiluted(with no other cannabinoids) you will feel like you just ate 250-500mg of edibles(within 20mins) for about 24hrs then the next 24hrs you’ll still be medicated and still feeling like lead. If you eat thcp or Hhcp it will last even longer. It’s like the vape equivalent of an edible if that makes sense. 

That’s just how these cannabinoids work. Be safe, enjoy them, but don’t underestimate them. They deserve a lot of respect. These cannabinoids vaped or eaten just have a very very long half life. These -p noids are waaaay stronger than D9.","altcannabinoids","r/altcannabinoids","2024-06-15T18:22:14.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not trying to be rude but you’re incorrect. 
If you vape thc-p, hhc-p etc. it will last 24hrs. You haven’t vaped straight thcp or hhcp if you don’t understand this, which is probably a good thing it’s very strong. You need to set out at least 24hrs to do nothing if you use these noids undiluted and sometimes even if they are diluted. Be very careful with these -p cannabinoids. 
They are great medicine but you only need a little bit. If you dab or vape one of these undiluted(with no other cannabinoids) you will feel like you just ate 250-500mg of edibles(within 20mins) for about 24hrs then the next 24hrs you’ll still be medicated and still feeling like lead. If you eat thcp or Hhcp it will last even longer. It’s like the vape equivalent of an edible if that makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s just how these cannabinoids work. Be safe, enjoy them, but don’t underestimate them. They deserve a lot of respect. These cannabinoids vaped or eaten just have a very very long half life. These -p noids are waaaay stronger than D9.&lt;/p&gt;

"Whoa, 300mg 🤯   I take 25mg. 

I would sleep for two days! Also that is knocking down your dopamine by a good bit - it's meant for folks in manic states where too much dopamine is present (like being on cocaine sober from my experience). Try trazadone or mirizapen if you haven't. 

I've noticed seroquel builds tolerance fast though. I prefer trazadone or mirizapen (Remeron) for non- narcotic sleep meds. Clonodine is a good prn as it works quickly but wears off fast.

Also, phenl gaba (phenebut) can work as well as kratom but  should not be used often. 

My psychiatrist and I agree that it is best to alternate different sleep meds each night that way no tolerance is built. I don't take a pill to sleep every night either. It helps to not drink alcohol, caffeine, or intake nicotine.

"Its pretty crazy your endlessly defending them when the plain and simple fact is they have no regards for safety and dont test what they receive, period. If they did do bare minimum testing, I wouldnt be calling them out.

So you think its okay for companies to sell a product and not test it? Manufacturers can produce hundreds of batches in a month and only test a handful of them. There is zero chance HAU is still selling distillate they made in august like gilded is advertising. This is why its the re-sellers responsibility to test what they receive.  Its easy for left over residuals to be left behind in a batch. Its their responsibility too test what they receive so they can return it if they get a bad batch.

Gilded isnt licensed in TX to begin with which gives zero confidence that they're breaking the distillate down in a sterile environment with protective equipment so that contaminants do not get into it. On top of that, they do ZERO testing on blends they make in house, which is extremely alarming considering it could easily be contaminated.

Without testing it, they could be selling tainted / contaminated distillate. If they decided to breakdown distillate to sell and make custom blends they need to be held to a standard.

"That’s wild, I had an ounce of their HHC batch made towards the end of last year and just smelled the half I have left, no hint of ammonia.  I’m absolutely familiar with the smell you mention though because it’s a very distinct one, had 2gs of THC-O from a VERY well known vendor last year, first gram dabbed great but I sat the second one aside “for later” and noticed that a month before the expiration date, it took on a STRONG vinegar/ammonia/urine smell that has only intensified since.

Wasn’t brave enough to take a dab of that one on its own but did make the mistake of adding a glob to a bowl of flower and smoking it - definitely got me turbo-stoned but it was harsh as fuck would not recommend lol.

I can’t do edibles or I would’ve went that route, I’d recommend you do the same but I’m still bummed to hear Gilded may have quality issues now, they were always very reliable for me in the past :/

"I use a nord 4 with rpm 2 pods and  1.2 ohm quartz coil. Very similar to yours. 

You’re going to want to add terps to thin it out some. I do anywhere from 5-7%. I usually fill mine then let it sit overnight or 24 hours. The next day I take a few dry pulls to see if I can taste the terps. 

Then I turn my device down to the lowest wattage (5 on the nord 4) and take a few really short pulls being really careful not to burn the coil or the whole tank will taste burnt.

Once I start getting some vapor I will raise it up one watt at a time and keep taking quick pulls without holding the button for too long until I reach my desired wattage

"I bought an elf thc back when they first came out. Thought it was stupid as hell but wanted to see just how bad it could be.

It tasted like garbage. Felt harsh on my throat. Had almost zero effects, and clogged after like ten pulls. Threw that shit in the trash so fast.

Never heard of Oracle but honestly I’ve never had a single headshop dispo that I’d rate higher than a 6/10. Budget’s are alright but $15 for a gram of d8 / hhc distillate is robbery. Looper XL’s gave me a really bad cough and the effects were mild. Kik by Kalibloom’s dispos were all overpriced garbage. Mellow Fellow’s do have decent effects but they’re like $30 at my local headshop, which once again is basically highway robbery. 

There are some cannabinoid edibles at my local shops that are cheap and potent, but they’re also made by really sketchy companies and the doses on the packaging is clearly a lie. 

Got some that claim 950mg d8, 20mg d9, 20mg live resin, and 3mg thcp. Pretty sure it’s just 3mg of thcp.

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say is to avoid smoke shop garbage. It’s almost all designed by made as cheap as possible and sold for much as possible. 9 times outta 10 if a store owner doesn’t know you and recommends you something, it’s an older product that doesn’t sell.&lt;/p&gt;

"Has anyone tried this? Was it successful? Is CBD/CBG Kief necessary to get the proper consistency? I have some THCA I was going to put in carts but decided not to in order to keep my blend as legal as possible. I'm thinking hash might be a good use for it without decarboxylating it into a crime.

I'm thinking

THCA - 2g - 25%

CBD Kief - 1.5g - 18.75%

CBG Kief - 1g - 12.5%

CBN Isolate - 1g - 12.5%

CBC Distillate - 1ml - 12.5%

CBT Distillate - 1ml -  12.5%

Terpenes - 0.5ml - 6.25%

My understanding of alt-noid hash is that distillate must be present in &lt;30% for it to hold form. Temple Ball hash can hold form after aging with 90%+ Bubble as it's starting material. Do you think this mix would have enough plant matter and Isolate to hold form in a pollen press and get the desired hard oxidized outer shell of heated and cooling during pressing as happens with regular 100% kief hash?

"Let me see if I have your formula correct:

37.5% isolates (diamonds and CBN)

30.75% kief, with unknown % plant material, most likely 50% plus or so. 

31.25% liquids (distillates and temps)

Or very roughly 2.5:2:2 isolates:kief:liquids

This should send you to the moon!

In my experience, however,  this will result in a  very gloopy mixture, and be rather a mess to handle. I would recommend increasing kief to at least 4 parts in the ratio and possibly 5. So either 2.5:4:2, iso:kief:liquid or 2.5:5:2: iso:kief:liquid. This should make your rather potent blend a bit easier to handle. Keep enough kief on hand while concocting hash to allow yourself  to adjust consistency to your liking.

A more expensive , but more potent way to make the blend easier to handle would be to add a significant quantity of THCA diamonds (isolate)to the mix, perhaps even doubling or tripling the isolate. If you do this, you may as well mainline the stuff! (Sorry for the boomer reference.) This becomes outrageously potent and expensive.","altcannabinoids","r/altcannabinoids","2024-06-15T02:34:00.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me see if I have your formula correct:&lt;/p&gt;

"Well ideally I'd use essentially my cart recipe which I've included below with 65% THCA diamonds replacing the various legal psychoactive alt-noids but I've never worked with diamonds before and I'm unsure how they react to pressurization and heating. I'm thinking adding CBD and CBG Kief would be necessary to achieve the right consistency so perhaps cutting the THCA to 50% and factoring in the kief would be 50% purity to hit the right dose for CBD/CBG and accommodate for texture. The recipe idea above is more of a test case using what I have on hand or can cheaply get.

Procedure would just be mixing everything together (maybe a rolling pin on folded over parchment paper to ensure a homogeneous mixture,) throwing it in a pollen press and 3-4 cycles of heating/cooling in the oven/freezer until maximum hand tightness has been achieved. Wrap it in seran wrap and age in a mason jar for 1-3 years.

I know this technique works on grinder kief which is likely 50% plant matter. You can achieve a hard dark brown outer shell with a soft lighter brown cookie dough textured interior using this method even without aging but I'm unsure how much of my successes there have been dependent on the plant matter percentage. 

Having to use 50% kief would kind of bum me out because it would throw off my C-Noid ratios and lead to a less balanced entourage effect. Maybe 2:1 CBG/CBD kief to limit the potency lowering properties of the CBD with a higher CBN dose to counteract the sativa-ey up from so much CBG?

I also know Temple Balls are made from 5-6 star bubble hash which is a full melt hash and well into the 90%'s as far as THC purity. If necessary I could use that method but it's extremely time consuming and I work full time plus it absolutely necessitates a 2-3 year curing to hold shape.

I'd definitely prefer to just press medallions and crank out a nice head stash in a night. Any idea what plant matter to cannabinoid ratio is necessary for pollen press hash?

Most importantly have you pressed THCA? Because I've heard even high grade hash can only hold form due to the microstructures of the trichomes holding the THC. This doesn't work with distillate which doesn't have them. Do we have any indication it would work with diamonds which decidedly also have no trichome microstructures or will it simply turn to goop and not oxidize a hard outer shell when exposed to low heat?

"the cheapest thing to do with the isolate is to pour your dose into a spoonful of peanut butter or Nutella and then eat it. CBN is psychoactive, at a strength of about ¼ that of THC. 

if you want something that's easier to measure, fill a dropper jar with MCT oil, and add the CBN to your desired concentration. you might need to put the oil in a warm water bath to get the CBN to fully dissolve. shake well before using

"I'm now noticing that you are in fact top commenter noting that CBC would be helpful. I think it's important to stress in this thread that THC is something to use in low concentration or not at all for a condition like this. Some here are suggesting HHC or THCA or ∆8 and im just not sure that OP is going to benefit at all from adding THC unless they're already a heavy toker.


There are studies of THC possibly reducing optic pressure and thus decreasing the risk of seizures but also some experience overstimulation of sensory imput and color alterations weird stuff like that would not be helpful for seizures at all.","altcannabinoids","r/altcannabinoids","2024-06-12T23:04:09.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now noticing that you are in fact top commenter noting that CBC would be helpful.

"Even cbd and any cannabinoid actually no matter if psychoactive or not can do nothing for epilepsy, they can only treat a little bit the seizures.

"There are no 100% reputable sources. Best is GE but they still lack every necessary test. They provide panels for Potency, Pesticides and Heavy Metals with every product. Some products they even have testing for fungal and microbial contamination iirc.

That's all good for extracted cannabinoids like the C-Series or THCA but when you get into semi-synthetic cannabinoids that have a psychoactive effect like ∆8, HHC etc. there's a whole new issue. These chemicals exist in such small quantities in natural flower that to bring them to market they have to be isomerized from CBD.

We know from the solvent test the solvents used in this process have been removed but without a reagent panel we don't know if all residual chemical reagents used in the conversion have been removed. Likewise the standard heavy metals test is insufficient for these compounds as Platinum and Palladium are apparently commonly used in industrial scale production but aren't tested for in the regular metals panel.

"HHC messes me up if I try to sleep with it at night.

Gave my wife real scares and I couldn’t say it was what I was smoking because she assumed it was straight weed and didn’t know I was using altcannabinoids.

All the other altcannabinoids don’t treat me this way, it’s specifically HHC. But it could also just be because I have asthma, but again, only HHC has done this to me.
